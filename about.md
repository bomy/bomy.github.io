Welcome to my blog. I'am web developer and live and work in [Taipei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei)(Taiwan), Using mostly the Microsoft .Net Framework, Javascript programming languages but i am exploring everything interesting. I want to use this blog to record my learning experience and share it with you!

This blog is made of a Jekyll-powered base on the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde). If there has any question and suggestion, feel free to communicate with me.
